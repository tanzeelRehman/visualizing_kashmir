# Visualizing Kashmir
Visualizing Kashmir mobile app communicates Kashmiri experiences to provoke narrative change. We envision a liberated future for Kashmiris in a world free from oppression. Visualizing Kashmir creates narrative interventions that convey the urgent and the actionable. 

We strive to capture not just stories of struggle, but of solidarity, steadfastness, and inspiration. Our visual tools ensure that factual, liberatory narratives about Kashmir are visible, accessible, and interconnected with those of other movements working for collectiveÂ liberation
